# Project Aim and Objective: 
## Forecasting MSFT Stock Prices
### Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop an accurate and robust forecasting model for Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock prices. By leveraging historical data and advanced time series techniques, we intend to predict future price movements, enabling informed investment decisions.


### Objective:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather historical MSFT stock price data, including daily open, close, high, and low prices.
 
Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and any irregularities.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct exploratory analysis to understand trends, seasonality, and potential patterns in the MSFT stock prices.

Visualize price fluctuations over time using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn.

### Time Series Modeling:

Utilize Python’s statsmodels library to build time series models.

Explore various models, including:

Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL): Identify seasonal patterns.

Prophet: A robust forecasting tool developed by Facebook for capturing seasonality and holidays.

### Forecasting Future Prices:

Generate forecasts for MSFT stock prices beyond the available historical data. 

Visualize the forecasted prices alongside actual historical prices.

### Integration with Power BI:

Integrate the forecasted results into a Power BI dashboard.

Create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore MSFT stock price trends and predictions.

### Expected Outcome:
By successfully implementing this project, we aim to provide investors, traders, and financial analysts with reliable insights into MSFT stock price movements.

The forecasted prices will assist in portfolio management, risk assessment, and strategic decision-making.
